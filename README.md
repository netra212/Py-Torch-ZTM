PyTorch Zero to Mastery

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my PyTorch Zero to Mastery repository. This is where I’m documenting my journey to mastering PyTorch, starting from scratch and progressing to advanced deep learning topics.

**📂 Folder Structure**

Here’s how I’ve organized everything:

📦 PyTorch-Zero-to-Mastery

  * ├── 📂 data                **# Datasets for experiments**
  
  * ├── 📂 notebooks           **# Jupyter notebooks for learning and experimenting**
  
  * ├── 📂 scripts             **# Python scripts for training and utilities**
  
  * ├── 📂 models              **# Pre-trained and custom models**
    
  * ├── 📂 experiments         **# Logs and results from training runs**
  
  * ├── 📂 resources          **# Helpful references and extra material**
  
  * └── README.md              **# This file!**

**🔧 Setup**

Here’s how to get started if you want to explore:

1. Clone the repo:
  git clone https://github.com/netra212/Py-Torch-ZTM.git
  cd PyTorch-Zero-to-Mastery

2. Create a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   > on macos source venv/bin/activate
   
   > On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
3. Install the required libraries:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

**🚀 What’s Inside**

This repo is all about learning and experimenting with PyTorch. Some of the topics I’ve covered (or plan to cover) include:

  * **PyTorch Basics:** Tensors, autograd, and computational graphs
  * **Building Neural Networks:** Layers, forward/backward passes, and training loops
  * **Datasets and DataLoaders:** Loading and preprocessing data
  * **Transfer Learning:** Leveraging pre-trained models
  * **Advanced Stuff:** GANs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.

**🛠️ How to Use**
  * Check out the notebooks folder for interactive learning.
  * Run training scripts in the scripts folder to test models.
  * All trained models are saved in the models folder, and logs/results go in experiments.

**📚 Resources**

I’m using a mix of tutorials, courses, and documentation to learn:

 * PyTorch Official Docs
 * Zero to Mastery Courses
 * PyTorch Tutorials

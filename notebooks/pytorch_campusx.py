import torch

# Tensor -> Data Structure or Multi-dimensional array designed for
# mathematical and computational efficiency.


# Real World Examples:
# 1. Scalar: 0-dimensional tensors (a single number)
# -> Represents a single value, often used for simple metrics or constants.
# -> Example:- Loss value: After forward pass, the loss function computes a
# single scalar value indicatign the difference between the predictred and
# actual ouputs.
